# MGR
Old School Windowing System

# About

MGR is a windowsing system from the late 80s and early nineties, meant to be more memory efficient and lightweight than X11. This repo has the goal of getting it running on as many machines as possible.

# Test system
The test system that I've compiled everything on is an AEG Olympia LT 386/SX. 
* 16 Mhz 386 SX
* 5 MB of ram
* Slackware 1.1.2 using linux kernel 1.0
* GCC version 2.5.8 (ANSI C)
